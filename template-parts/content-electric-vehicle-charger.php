                                and help our clients reduce their negative impact on the environment while living more
                                convenient lives. Electric cars have been rapidly rising in popularity throughout the
                                United States over the last few years, and it's important that as their popularity
                                continues to grow, the demand for EV charging stations is met.</p>

                                <p>At EB Electrical, we install level 2 chargers for electric vehicles. The charger runs
                                    on 240-volt AC and can charge at a speed of 25 miles per hour. This means that an EV
                                    battery can fully charge overnight, unless you have a 240-volt outlet installed on
                                    your property already. If not, our installation team can install one at your home or
                                    office at reasonable prices.</p>
