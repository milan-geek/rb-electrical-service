                            <p>Uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) are devices that provide backup power to your
                                computer and other devices in the event of a power outage. A UPS typically consists of a
                                battery, an inverter, surge protection, and other electronics. When a drop in voltage
                                occurs, the UPS detects it and switches over to battery backup. Components plugged into
                                the UPS can then receive power for a limited amount of time (often ranging from 10 to 45
                                minutes), until normal power is restored or the system can shut down properly.</p>

                            <p>When the power goes out and your home is plunged into darkness, you worry about more than
                                just losing your favorite TV show. You also worry about how to keep your fridge running
                                and your lights on. With a home backup system in place, though, you can weather any
                                storm.</p>
                            <p>A home backup system provides power to your home in case of a power outage so you can
                                keep your lights on and your fridge running. There are different types of home backup
                                power systems on the market. The most popular is a battery backup power system. These
                                systems use batteries to store energy and then release it when the power goes out. Other
                                home backup power systems use generators to create electricity. These can be either
                                gas-powered or solar-powered. Compared to gas generators, solar-powered generators are
                                an excellent option for safety and sustainability because they do not have harmful
                                emissions.</p>
                            <p>RB Electrical helps you figure out which type of system is right for your needs and
                                installs it for you!</p>
